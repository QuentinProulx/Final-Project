# Final-Project
This is my final project for the data structures and object oriented programming course at Vanier College

This project operates as a convenience store management system. It will manage all the items and customers such that the store knows how many products to order and how much money to spend. It will manage the employee discounts, and whether a customer of a certain age is allowed to buy a product. It will also manage the utilities that the store chooses to buy. It will handle both rented and bought utilities and will manage their costs to the store.

The purpose of this program is to aid the management of a convenience store so that theyâ€™re able to know exactly when and where their money is going and change what is being ordered to maximize their profits.
